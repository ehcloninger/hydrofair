The Hydro Free Fair has a special meaning to those of us that grew up here. We have
great memories of riding the rides and playing the games in our youth. We volunteer 
our time, effort, tools, and money to make those memories special for our children and
grandchildren.

If you enjoy the Hydro Fair but can't donate your time, you can still be a valuable
contributor. Donations from friends and grants from corporations have recently paid 
for the improvements to the train and carousel. **Your donations are appreciated.**
