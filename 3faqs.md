**Q: What is the cost of admission?**

**A:** The Hydro Free Fair is free to attend. Tickets for rides and games are available throughout the fairgrounds.

**Q: Where can I park?**

**A:** Parking is available on city streets near the fairgrounds. Please do not park near the livestock barns while judging is underway. There are large parking areas available north and south of the rodeo arena. If you are parked several blocks from the fairgrounds, look for our friendly assistants in golf carts, who are happy to give you a lift to and from the front gate.

**Q: When is the next Hydro Free Fair?**

**A:** The Hydro Fair is always the second weekend preceding Labor Day weekend.

**Q: Is it true some kid died on the Green Machine?**

**A:** That's something your older brother told you so you would leave him alone. The kid actually died on the Hustler.
